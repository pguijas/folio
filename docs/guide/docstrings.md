# Writing Doc Comments

*How to write doc comments that produce clear, complete API documentation.*

Most of this page is about Python docstrings; [JSDoc](#jsdoc) and
[Rust doc comments](#rust-doc-comments) close it.

For Python, Folio supports **Google-style** and **NumPy-style** docstrings. By
default, Folio auto-detects the style for each docstring, and the detection
also reads reStructuredText and epydoc docstrings. You can force a parser with
`source.python.docstring_style` in `docs.yaml`, which takes `"auto"`,
`"google"` or `"numpy"` (see
[Configuration](./configuration#sourcepython)).

## Google-style format

Google-style parsing is built in. Set `source.python.docstring_style` to
`"google"` when you want to force this parser for every docstring:

```yaml
source:
  python:
    docstring_style: "google"
```

A basic Google-style docstring looks like this:

```python
def connect(host: str, port: int = 8080, timeout: float = 30.0) -> Connection:
    """Establish a connection to the remote server.

    Opens a TCP connection using the specified host and port. The connection
    will be kept alive until explicitly closed or the timeout is reached.

    Args:
        host: The hostname or IP address to connect to.
        port: The port number. Defaults to 8080.
        timeout: Maximum time in seconds to wait for the connection.

    Returns:
        A Connection object representing the active connection.

    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If the server is unreachable.
        ValueError: If the host string is empty.

    Examples:
        >>> conn = connect("localhost")
        >>> conn.is_alive()
        True

    Notes:
        This function does not support Unix domain sockets.
    """
```

## NumPy-style format

To use NumPy-style docstrings, set `source.python.docstring_style` to `"numpy"` in your `docs.yaml`:

```yaml
source:
  python:
    docstring_style: "numpy"
```

A NumPy-style docstring uses section headers with underlines instead of trailing colons:

```python
def connect(host: str, port: int = 8080) -> Connection:
    """Establish a connection to the remote server.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : str
        The hostname or IP address.
    port : int, optional
        The port number, by default 8080.

    Returns
    -------
    Connection
        The active connection object.

    Raises
    ------
    ConnectionError
        If the server is unreachable.
    """
```

The default `source.python.docstring_style` value is `"auto"`, which detects the
style on a per-docstring basis: it parses each docstring as reStructuredText,
Google, NumPy and epydoc, and keeps whichever reading finds the most
parameters, returns, raises and other fields.
This is useful for projects that mix conventions or are migrating from one
style to the other.

## Docstring sections

Folio recognizes the following sections in a docstring. A Google-style heading
is written as shown, capitalized and followed by a colon; a NumPy-style heading
is underlined. Google-style also accepts `Arguments:`, `Parameters:` and
`Params:` for `Args:`, `Exceptions:` and `Except:` for `Raises:`, `Example:`
for `Examples:`, and `Note:` for `Notes:`.

### Args

Document function parameters under the `Args:` section. Each parameter is listed on its
own line with an indented description:

```python
def train(data: Dataset, epochs: int = 10, lr: float = 0.001) -> Model:
    """Train a model on the given dataset.

    Args:
        data: The training dataset.
        epochs: Number of training epochs.
        lr: Learning rate for the optimizer.
    """
```

### Returns

Describe the return value under `Returns:`:

```python
def load(path: str) -> dict:
    """Load configuration from a YAML file.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the parsed configuration.
    """
```

### Raises

List exceptions the function may raise under `Raises:`:

```python
def parse(text: str) -> AST:
    """Parse source code into an AST.

    Raises:
        SyntaxError: If the source code is invalid.
        FileNotFoundError: If the source file does not exist.
    """
```

### Examples

Provide usage examples under `Examples:`. These are rendered as code blocks in the
generated docs:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers.

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(-1, 1)
        0
    """
```

### Notes

Add extra context under `Notes:`. This section is useful for implementation details,
caveats, or related information:

```python
def encrypt(data: bytes, key: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Encrypt data using AES-256-GCM.

    Notes:
        The nonce is generated randomly and prepended to the ciphertext.
        This function is not suitable for encrypting data larger than 2 GiB.
    """
```

### Other sections

`Attributes:` describes a class's attributes or a module's constants (see
[Class variables](#class-variables)). `Deprecated:`, `Warning:`, `See Also:`,
`References:` and `Todo:` each render as a labelled paragraph after the
description, such as **Deprecated:** followed by the section's text. Sphinx
roles such as `` :class:`Config` `` and `` :meth:`load` `` read as code.

## Type annotations

folio extracts type information from two places, in order of priority:

1. **Function signatures** (preferred) — type annotations on parameters and return types
2. **Docstring type fields** — the `(type)` syntax in Google-style docstrings

If a parameter has a type annotation in the function signature, that takes precedence.
If there is no signature annotation, folio falls back to the type specified in the
docstring.

```python
# Type from signature (preferred)
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a user.

    Args:
        name: The user's name.
    """

# Type from docstring (fallback)
def greet(name):
    """Greet a user.

    Args:
        name (str): The user's name.

    Returns:
        str: A greeting message.
    """
```

Both styles produce the same output. When both are present, the signature annotation wins.

## Decorators and method kinds

folio detects decorators on functions and methods and renders them differently
based on their kind.

### @property

A property is marked `@property` above its heading, its signature is its name,
and its return annotation is shown as its **Type**. The getter docstring is the
description, and no parameters are listed. A setter or deleter written as
`@full_name.setter` or `@full_name.deleter` folds into the property instead of
getting an entry of its own:

```python
class User:
    @property
    def full_name(self) -> str:
        """The user's full name, computed from first and last name."""
        return f"{self.first} {self.last}"
```

### @staticmethod

Static methods are marked `@staticmethod` above their heading. Since they don't
receive `self` or `cls`, all parameters are documented:

```python
class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def clamp(value: float, low: float, high: float) -> float:
        """Clamp a value to a range.

        Args:
            value: The value to clamp.
            low: Minimum bound.
            high: Maximum bound.
        """
```

### @classmethod

Class methods are marked `@classmethod` above their heading. The `cls`
parameter is left out of the signature and the parameter table, just like
`self`:

```python
class Config:
    @classmethod
    def from_file(cls, path: str) -> "Config":
        """Load configuration from a file.

        Args:
            path: Path to the configuration file.
        """
```

### Custom decorators

Every other decorator is shown as written, above the signature:

```python
class EventHandler:
    @retry(max_attempts=3)
    def handle(self, event: Event) -> None:
        """Handle an incoming event with automatic retry."""
```

## *args and **kwargs

Variable positional and keyword arguments are fully supported. They appear in the
documentation with their `*` or `**` prefix implied by their argument kind:

```python
def log(message: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
    """Log a message with optional formatting arguments.

    Args:
        message: The log message template.
        *args: Positional arguments for string formatting.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the logger.
    """
```

The parser tracks argument kinds internally: `var_positional` for `*args` and
`var_keyword` for `**kwargs`. Keyword-only arguments (those after `*` in the
signature) are tracked as `keyword_only`.

## Controlling what gets documented with \_\_all\_\_

Without `__all__`, Folio documents every top-level class, function and constant
whose name does not start with an underscore. Defining `__all__` restricts the
page to the names it lists, and a listed name is documented even with a
leading underscore:

```python
__all__ = ["PublicClass", "public_function", "_listed_helper"]

class PublicClass:
    """This will be documented."""

class _InternalHelper:
    """Not listed, so not documented; without __all__ its underscore keeps it out."""

def public_function():
    """This will be documented."""

def helper():
    """This will NOT be documented because it's not in __all__."""

def _listed_helper():
    """Documented: __all__ lists it."""
```

Inside a class, a member whose name starts with an underscore is skipped, with
two exceptions: `__init__` is always documented, and any other dunder method,
such as `__call__` or `__eq__`, is documented when it has a docstring. When a
function has `@overload` stubs, only its implementation is shown.

**`__all__` must be a simple list or tuple of string literals**, annotated or
not. Folio parses it statically from the AST, so a dynamic construction like
`__all__ = get_exports()` is not read, and the module falls back to the
underscore rule.

## Nested classes

folio fully supports nested (inner) classes. They are parsed recursively and
appear as sub-sections within their parent class documentation:

```python
class Model:
    """A machine learning model.

    The Model class supports nested configuration via inner classes.
    """

    class Config:
        """Model configuration.

        Args are defined as class variables with type annotations.
        """
        learning_rate: float = 0.001
        batch_size: int = 32

    class Callbacks:
        """Lifecycle callbacks for training."""

        def on_epoch_end(self, epoch: int, metrics: dict) -> None:
            """Called at the end of each training epoch.

            Args:
                epoch: The epoch number that just completed.
                metrics: Dictionary of metric names to values.
            """
```

Inner classes have their own methods, class variables, and can even contain further
nested classes.

## Module-level constants

folio documents module-level constants in two ways:

**With type annotations** — any top-level annotated assignment is captured:

```python
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT: float = 30.0
MAX_RETRIES: int = 3
API_BASE_URL: str = "https://api.example.com"
```

**Without type annotations** — only UPPER_CASE names (without a leading underscore) are
captured:

```python
VERSION = "1.0.0"          # documented (UPPER_CASE)
DEFAULT_PORT = 8080        # documented (UPPER_CASE)
_internal_cache = {}       # NOT documented (leading underscore)
some_config = "value"      # NOT documented (not UPPER_CASE)
```

The constant's name, type (if annotated), and assigned value are all shown in the
generated documentation. An `Attributes:` section in the module docstring gives
a constant its description.

## Class variables

Assignments inside a class body, annotated or not, are documented as class
attributes, and so are an enum's members:

```python
class Server:
    """An HTTP server.

    Attributes:
        host: The interface to bind.
        port: The TCP port.
        workers (int): Worker processes, set in __init__.
    """
    host: str = "localhost"
    port = 8080
```

They appear in a table in the class section with each attribute's name, type,
value and description. The description comes from the class docstring's
`Attributes:` section, whose type fills in when the assignment has no
annotation; an attribute the section names but the class body does not
assign, such as one set in `__init__`, gets a row without a value.

## Async functions

Async functions and methods are fully supported. Their signature keeps the
`async` keyword, as in `async def fetch(url: str, timeout: float = 10.0)`:

```python
async def fetch(url: str, timeout: float = 10.0) -> Response:
    """Fetch a resource from the given URL.

    Args:
        url: The URL to fetch.
        timeout: Maximum time to wait in seconds.

    Returns:
        The HTTP response.

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If the request exceeds the timeout.
    """
```

## Tips for writing good docstrings

**Start with a one-line summary.** The first line of your docstring becomes the short
description: a module's is its description in the API index, the page metadata
and `llms.txt`. Keep it concise and action-oriented (e.g., "Connect to the
database" not "This function connects to the database").

**Separate the summary from the body.** Leave a blank line between the summary and the
longer description. The parser treats the first line as `short_description` and
everything after the blank line as `long_description`.

**Document all public parameters.** Every parameter that appears in the function
signature should have a corresponding entry in the `Args:` (Google) or `Parameters`
(NumPy) section. Missing descriptions will render as empty in the docs.

**Use type annotations in signatures.** Prefer `def foo(x: int)` over documenting types
in the docstring. Signature annotations are more reliable and are checked by type
checkers like mypy.

**Keep examples runnable.** Examples in the `Examples:` section should be valid Python
that a reader could copy-paste. Use `>>>` prefix for interactive-style examples.

**Document exceptions explicitly.** If your function raises exceptions, list them in the
`Raises:` section. This helps users write proper error handling code.

## Complete example

Here is a well-documented module that brings the Google-style features of this
guide together:

```python
"""Connection management for the RPC framework.

This module provides connection pooling and lifecycle management
for RPC clients.
"""

__all__ = ["ConnectionPool", "DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE"]

DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE: int = 10

class ConnectionPool:
    """A thread-safe pool of reusable connections.

    The pool maintains a set of open connections and distributes them
    to callers on demand. Connections are returned to the pool when
    released.

    Examples:
        >>> pool = ConnectionPool("localhost", max_size=5)
        >>> async with pool.acquire() as conn:
        ...     await conn.execute("SELECT 1")

    Notes:
        The pool does not currently support connection health checks.
    """

    max_size: int = DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE
    timeout: float = 30.0

    class Stats:
        """Pool usage statistics."""
        active: int = 0
        idle: int = 0

    def __init__(self, host: str, port: int = 5432, max_size: int = 10) -> None:
        """Initialize the connection pool.

        Args:
            host: Database hostname.
            port: Database port.
            max_size: Maximum number of connections in the pool.
        """

    async def acquire(self, timeout: float | None = None) -> Connection:
        """Acquire a connection from the pool.

        Args:
            timeout: Maximum time to wait for a connection.
                If None, uses the pool's default timeout.

        Returns:
            An open database connection.

        Raises:
            PoolExhaustedError: If no connection is available within the timeout.
        """

    @property
    def size(self) -> int:
        """The current number of connections in the pool."""

    @classmethod
    def from_url(cls, url: str) -> "ConnectionPool":
        """Create a pool from a database URL.

        Args:
            url: A connection string like ``postgresql://host:port/db``.
        """

    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_url(url: str) -> bool:
        """Check whether a connection string is valid.

        Args:
            url: The connection string to validate.
        """
```

## JSDoc

The JavaScript reader takes the `/** ... */` comment written directly above an
exported declaration, with no blank line between them. A file's first comment
documents the module when a blank line separates it from the code below.

```javascript
/**
 * Connect to a server.
 *
 * Opens a connection; see {@link Connection} for what it returns.
 * @param {string} host - The hostname.
 * @param {Object} [options] - Connection options.
 * @param {number} [options.port=8080] - The port.
 * @returns {Connection} The open connection.
 * @throws {TypeError} If the host is empty.
 * @deprecated Use open instead.
 * @example
 * connect("localhost", { port: 9000 })
 */
export function connect(host, options = {}) {}
```

The description comes first, then one parameter row per `@param`: `[name]`
is read as the parameter's name (the row does not mark it optional),
`[name=default]` gives its default, and `options.port` becomes a row of its own
after `options`. `@returns` (or `@return`) and `@throws` fill the return and
raise lines, `@deprecated` renders as a **Deprecated:** paragraph, and each
`@example` becomes a code block.
`{@link Target}` reads as `Target` in code, `{@link Target text}` or
`{@link Target|text}` as its text, and a URL target as a link. A parameter
without a JSDoc type shows `Any`. Other tags are not read.

## Rust doc comments

The Rust reader takes `///` and `#[doc = "..."]` comments on an item and `//!`
comments for the module, and reads their Markdown as rustdoc does:

- a code block without a language, or tagged only with rustdoc attributes
  such as `no_run` or `should_panic`, is Rust;
- lines starting with `# ` inside a Rust block are hidden, as in rustdoc
  output, and `##` at the start of a line stands for a literal `#`;
- intra-doc links such as `` [`Config`] ``, `[the config][Config]` and
  `[text](crate::Config)` keep their text, and URL links stay links;
- headings such as `# Examples` and `# Panics` sit below the item's own
  heading.

A Rust function shows its signature as written, with no linked types, and its
doc comment; there is no parameter table. `#[doc = include_str!("...")]` is not
read in this release.
