# Migrating from Sphinx

*Step-by-step guide to moving a Sphinx project to Folio by hand.*

One-command importers, from MkDocs, Mintlify or Read the Docs: Not available in this
release. [Why Folio](./why-folio) covers the reasons to switch; this page covers the
move.

## Step-by-step migration

### 1. Install Folio

Follow [Installation](./installation).

### 2. Initialize configuration

Run the init command in your project root. It reads the project name and version
from `pyproject.toml` and finds the source directory on disk:

```bash
folio init
```

This creates a `docs.yaml` file. Edit it to point to your Python source directories:

```yaml
project:
  name: "my-project"
  version: "1.0.0"
  repo: "https://github.com/org/my-project"

source:
  python:
    paths:
      - "src/my_project/"
    exclude:
      - "src/my_project/_vendor/"
  docs:
    - "docs/"

nav:
  - "Guide"
  - "API Reference"
```

### 3. Convert existing documentation

Keep existing Markdown pages and review any directives or components specific to
your previous documentation tool.

If you have hand-written documentation in `.rst` format, convert it to Markdown before
adding it to `source.docs`. Folio does not ship or invoke an RST converter; use your
migration tool of choice, review the generated Markdown, and then let Folio build the
converted pages.

Folio warns about `.rst` files only when those files are still present inside a
directory listed in `source.docs`. It does not emit a warning if the `.rst` files were
already removed before running `folio build` or `folio serve`.

Name guide files and directories with hyphens, not underscores: write
`common-errors/index.md`, published at `/docs/common-errors/`. In this release a
guide page whose path contains an underscore, such as `common_errors/index.md`,
renders a not-found page at both `/docs/common_errors/` and `/docs/common-errors/`.
Old Sphinx URLs are not redirected. API reference routes are the exception: Python
package and module names keep their underscores.

### 4. Leave your docstrings alone

Your docstrings need no conversion. With `docstring_style: "auto"`, the
default, Folio detects the style per docstring and reads reStructuredText
(`:param name:`), Google, NumPy and epydoc. Set `source.python.docstring_style`
only to pin one style for a codebase that mixes them by accident.

### 5. Remove the previous documentation setup

Once migration is verified, remove configuration and dependencies used only by
your previous documentation tool. For a Sphinx project, these may include:

- `conf.py`
- `Makefile` (if only used for docs)
- `make.bat`
- `_build/` directory
- `_static/`, `_templates/` directories
- Sphinx from your dependencies

### 6. Build and verify

```bash
folio serve
```

This starts a dev server at `http://localhost:4321` where you can verify your
documentation looks correct.

## Mapping Sphinx concepts to Folio

### conf.py to docs.yaml

| Sphinx `conf.py` | Folio `docs.yaml` |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| `project = "Name"` | `project.name: "Name"` |
| `version = "1.0"` | `project.version: "1.0"` |
| `extensions = ["autodoc"]` | Not needed (automatic) |
| `html_theme = "furo"` | Built-in theme presets (see [Theming](./theming/index)) |
| `html_static_path` | `public:` for files served from the site root; images a page uses go beside the page |
| `html_logo` | `theme.logo` |
| `html_favicon` | `theme.favicon` |
| `exclude_patterns` | `source.python.exclude` |
| `autodoc_member_order` | Not configurable (source order) |

### autodoc to automatic generation

In Sphinx, you write explicit directives to pull in API documentation:

```rst
.. automodule:: my_project.core
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```

In Folio, you list your source directories and everything is documented
automatically:

```yaml
source:
  python:
    paths:
      - "src/my_project/"
```

No per-module directives needed. Use `__all__` in your Python modules to control which
symbols appear in the documentation.

### RST directives

Folio does not translate RST directives during a build. Convert them before adding the
page to `source.docs`, then review common constructs against this mapping:

**Common manual rewrites:**

| RST Directive | Converted To |
|---------------|-------------|
| `.. code-block:: python` | Fenced code block (` ```python `) |
| `.. note::` | Callout (note) |
| `.. warning::` | Callout (warning) |
| `.. tip::` | Callout (tip) |
| `.. hint::` | Callout (tip) |
| `.. danger::` | Callout (danger) |
| `.. error::` | Callout (danger) |
| `.. important::` | Callout (warning) |
| `.. caution::` | Callout (warning) |
| `.. attention::` | Callout (warning) |
| `.. seealso::` | Callout (info) |
| `.. deprecated::` | Callout (danger) with version |
| `.. versionadded::` | Callout (note) with version |
| `.. versionchanged::` | Callout (note) with version |
| `.. image:: path` | `![path](path)` |
| RST headings (underlines) | Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) |
| `` ``inline code`` `` | `` `inline code` `` |
| `` :role:`text` `` | `` `text` `` |

**Features that need manual redesign:**

| RST Feature | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| `.. toctree::` | Not needed (auto-generated navigation) |
| `.. include::` | Not supported |
| `.. math::` | `$$` block, rendered with KaTeX (inline: `$…$`) |
| `.. table::` | Use Markdown tables instead |
| `.. raw::` | Not supported |
| `.. tab-set::` / `.. tab-item::` | Convert manually to `<Tabs>` and `<TabItem>` |
| `.. only::` | Not supported |
| Cross-references (`:ref:`, `:doc:`) | Not available in this release; use Markdown links |
| Substitutions (`\|name\|`) | Not supported |
| Field lists (`:field:`) | Not supported |
| Footnotes | Markdown footnotes (`[^1]`) |

For Sphinx tab sets, rewrite each block with Folio's MDX tabs components:

````mdx
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    import my_library
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="CLI">
    ```bash
    my-library run
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

For callouts that were written as Markdown blockquotes during migration, use Folio's
`Callout` component directly. Patterns such as `> **Warning:**` should become
`<Callout type="warning">`. For example, convert `> **Warning:** This changes state.`
to:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  This changes state.
</Callout>
```

### Sphinx extensions to Folio features

Many common Sphinx extension use cases are built into Folio.
Custom extensions: Not available in this release.

| Sphinx Extension | Folio Equivalent |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `autodoc` | Built-in (automatic) |
| `napoleon` | Built-in (Google and NumPy styles) |
| `viewcode` | Built-in: each definition links to its source line when `project.repo` is set |
| `intersphinx` | Not available in this release |
| `todo` | Not supported |
| `coverage` | Built-in (`folio coverage`) |
| `doctest` | Not supported |
| `sphinx-copybutton` | Built-in (code blocks have copy buttons) |
| Custom extensions | Not available in this release |

### make html to folio build

| Sphinx Command | Folio Command |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `make html` | `folio build` |
| `make clean` | `folio clean` |
| `sphinx-autobuild` | `folio serve` |
| `sphinx-quickstart` | `folio init` |

## What works differently

### Sphinx roles do not link

Sphinx has an extensive cross-reference system (`:class:`, `:func:`, `:meth:`, etc.) that
creates links between documented symbols. Folio generates API links for parsed type
annotations; Sphinx role syntax is Not available in this release. In a docstring a role
reads as code, unlinked: `` :class:`MyClass` `` renders as `MyClass`. In a Markdown page
a role stays as written. Replace roles with Markdown links where you need the link.

### No intersphinx

Sphinx's `intersphinx` extension lets you link to other projects' documentation.
Intersphinx is Not available in this release. If your docs link heavily to external
API documentation (for example the Python standard library), replace those links
with plain URLs.

### Source order, not alphabetical

Folio documents members in the order they appear in the source file. Sphinx's
`autodoc_member_order` option with alphabetical sorting has no equivalent.

### Only the field lists of reStructuredText docstrings

Folio reads the Sphinx field lists in docstrings (`:param x:`, `:type x:`, `:returns:`,
`:rtype:`, `:raises:`). Other reStructuredText markup in a docstring, such as
substitutions, directives or grid tables, is not converted and shows as written.

## Common gotchas

**Docstring parsing errors.** If no style parses a docstring, Folio falls back to
the first line as the summary and the rest as the description. The parameter table
still lists the signature's parameters, without descriptions. Indentation matters: in
a Google-style section, a line at column zero ends the section and the lines from
there to the next section header are dropped.

**Missing `__init__` docs.** Folio documents `__init__` like any other method. If
you were relying on Sphinx's `autoclass_content = "both"` to merge class and `__init__`
docstrings, you may need to adjust your docstrings.

**Private members.** Without `__all__`, Folio documents every top-level class,
function and annotated variable, and every unannotated assignment to an upper-case
name, when the name does not start with `_`. Define `__all__` in a module to choose
exactly what appears: it can list a class, function or annotated variable whose name
starts with `_`, while an unannotated assignment still needs an upper-case name
without a leading `_`.

**MyST directives disappear silently.** A fenced block whose info string is in
braces, such as MyST's `{note}` or `{eval-rst}`, is removed with its content, and the
build does not warn. Rewrite each one in Markdown or as a component before adding the
page to `source.docs`. An importer that rewrites these blocks, tab sets and
blockquote-style callouts: Not available in this release.

**Raw embeds disappear silently.** The Markdown-to-MDX step removes raw
`<iframe>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<object>`, and `<embed>`
elements, inside code blocks too, and the build does not warn. Use a normal Markdown
link or a documented component instead of a raw YouTube or HTML embed.

**Images stay beside the page.** An image path relative to the page is copied with
it, as long as the file sits in the page's directory or below it. A path with `..`
is removed from the page and the build warns
`image not found: ../img.png (escapes the docs directory)`.

**Curly braces are escaped for you.** Folio outputs MDX, where a bare `{` starts a
JSX expression, so it escapes bare braces in prose; code blocks, inline code and
`$…$` math pass through untouched. A line that starts with `<` is treated as JSX and
left alone, so a literal brace on such a line needs a backslash (`\{`).

**Markdown details that change.** Links to `.md` files drop the extension and point
at the published page; `class=` on an HTML tag becomes `className=`; a `mermaid`
fence renders as a diagram.
