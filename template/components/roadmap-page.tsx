/**
 * The /roadmap page: the masthead, then one card per product.
 *
 * Both roadmaps are on the page at once. The version before this one put a
 * switcher in the header and drew a single project at a time, which meant the
 * product you were not reading was not on the page — and with two products
 * that is half the roadmap behind a control nobody asked for. It also kept the
 * unselected releases out of the served HTML.
 *
 * `?product=<key>` collapses every card but one, so a product landing can link
 * straight to its own plan. Without it every card is open, which is what the
 * server renders.
 *
 * A server component. `roadmap.tsx` still draws the landing's miniature and
 * the embeds in the guides, unchanged.

 * The static HTML renders every card open, and the query string only reaches
 * React after hydration — so arriving at `/roadmap/?product=agents` from a
 * product landing painted both roadmaps and then pulled ~460px out from under
 * the reader when the other card closed. That is the largest movement on the
 * page and nobody authored it.
 *
 * So the page ships one rule per project and five lines that set an attribute,
 * the same shape the template already uses to settle the theme before paint.
 * The React effect then takes over and `RoadmapCards` drops the attribute on
 * the commit that follows, so CSS and state hand over with nothing moving.
